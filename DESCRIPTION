Description: Contains scripts to download, import, manipulate, plot, and have 
    fun with the King County marine data. Data considered are from moorings, 
    CTD profiles, and discrete samples. Some functions may only be available 
    to King County employees, since some data access requires a VPN 
    connection. Contact Taylor with any issues or requests.
